## Overview of the school district analysis
In this analysis, we will be taking a specific group of data and redoing all of our initial analysis with the new dataset.  We will begin by removing all of the Thomas High School 9th Graders math and reading scores and then recalculating the district and school summaries to see the differences between the two analysis.
## Results:       
-The district summary was only slightly affect towards higher percents of passing students.
